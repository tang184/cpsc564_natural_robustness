# cpsc564 Natural Robustness on Image Data Augmentation

This repository includes the different augmentation methods training and evaluation on the ImageNet dataset and Youtube YTBB dataset.
The code is written using Python Jupyter Notebook to display results of the evaluation on different augmentation methods.

For each model sub directory, it includes the augmentation method(either python file or notebook), the training notebook, and the evaluation notebook and the generated ResNet18 weight model which can be used for future analysis.
